# ## Set up the fitness calculations 
# 
# This calls an external executable to return a fitness value. You cannot modify the code in this executable. 
# 
# 
# 2. **If you are running on Windows using Anaconda, then your code needs to call the executables "bit_cam_napier_windows.exe" and "bit_cam_napier_visualisation_windows.exe" - you need to specify the exact path to these on your system in the code below**
# 
# The call to the external function is wrapped inside an evaluation function called **eval_function()** .. this has the standard form used by DEAP and should be registered with the toolbox as usual. Read the following carefully.    You can use any code you wish inside this function but it must always call the external *objective_function()* with a valid solution. This is defined below
# 
# 
#  - The external "objective_function" needs to be passed a list of length (where n is the number of cells) where each value is 0 or 1.
# - There must be exactly c values set to 1, where c= number of cameras
# - Regardless of the representation you use, **you must turn a DEAP individual into a list of the form specified above** before calling the objective_function
# 
# 
# **WARNING!!! You should only call the *objective_function* with a list that has exactly *c* bits set to 1**
# 
# If this is not the case, then you should assign a fitness value to the individual without calling the external  *objective_function*. You can choose how to set this - the fitness you assign should reflect the fact that the solution is invalid.  For a valid solution, the worst possible fitness is equal to *num_cells*, i.e. no cell is covered. Therefore, the fitness you choose to assign to an invalid solution should be worse than this value

#  

# set the correct binary depending on your machine/setup - you need to choose one of the options below and set the path correctly

# for MacOS
#path_binary = "/path-to-binary/bit_cam_napier_mac"
#path_binary_vis = "/path-to-binary/bit_cam_napier_visualisation_mac"
